# Repository Description:

This repository hosts a console application where I explore and apply the fundamentals of configuring databases using Entity Framework Core. Throughout the project, I delve into the intricacies of setting up and managing databases through the powerful features offered by Entity Framework Core. The application serves as a hands-on learning experience, covering aspects such as creating models, defining relationships, utilizing migrations to evolve the database schema over time, and implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for comprehensive database interaction.

Key Features:

Entity Framework Core implementation in a console application.
Database configuration, including model creation and relationship management.
Hands-on exploration of migrations to adapt the database schema.
Implementation of CRUD operations for complete database interaction.
Feel free to explore the codebase to understand the practical aspects of working with Entity Framework Core in a console application. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcomed!
